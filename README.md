ðŸ¦€ Rust Fun ðŸ¦€

Rust is always fun, even when it panics.
This repo currently just contains the Fibonacci sequence in Rust with a couple examples of the function running in the main file.

This needs to be refactored to somehow allow for multiple fun examples within one Cargo project. Need to look into how multiple entrypoints might be possible based on arguments, possibly need to use a CLI library.
